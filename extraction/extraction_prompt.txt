After receiving this instructions you will be given an article text from which you have to extract data strictly following all of the requirements listed below.
Extract data from this article and its supplementary provided in pdf, to .json format with specifications. You should search in provided in article links too. There may be several DNA probes and experiments, so different ids should correspond, and several fields should be duplicated.
Do it accurately and extract all the data, but do not create any by yourself or otherwise you will be terminated.
Example output without formatting, but you will need to provide perfectly formatted pretty JSON:
```json
