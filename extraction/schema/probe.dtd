<!--
  Explanation of elements:
  probe_samples: the root element containing the DOI of the article and one or more probe groups.
  doi: a unique identifier for the article in DOI format. Must be filled out.
  probe_group: a group of samples containing a unique identifier for the sample group, an array of experiment identifiers, results of experiments, and related sequences.
  id_group: integer. a unique identifier for the sample group. Must be filled out.
  results: an element that contains one or more results from experiments. Might be several.
  result: an element representing a single result, which includes an experiment ID, an outcome description,
  and fluorescence measurement.
  id_exp: integer, a unique identifier for the experiment. Must be filled out.
  outcome: boolean, result of the experiment. Must be filled out.
  fluorescence: a measurement of fluorescence associated with the experiment result.
  sequences: an element containing information about related sequences and probe sequences used in experiments.
  related_sequences: an element containing one or more related sequences that are pertinent to the experiment. Might be several, must be at least one.
  related_sequence: a single related sequence in text format (primers for example). Must contain nucleotides (A, T, C, G, or degenerated) and be non-empty.
  probes: an element containing one or more probes used in the experiments.
  probe: an element representing a single probe, which includes its ID, sequence, and any modifications. Might be several, must be at least one.
  id_probe: integer, a unique identifier for the probe. Must be filled out.
  probe_sequence: a probe sequence in text format. Must contain nucleotides (A, T, C, G, or degenerated) and be non-empty.
  modification: an element representing modifications to the probe sequence, including position and type. Might be several.
  modification_pos: the position of the modification in the probe sequence.
  modification_type: the type of modification applied to the probe.
